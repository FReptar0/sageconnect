# Security Policy  
  
## Overview  
  
SAGECONNECT is a financial integration system that handles sensitive ERP data, API credentials, and multi-tenant configurations. This document outlines security practices and vulnerability reporting procedures.  
  
## Supported Versions  
  
| Version | Supported          |  
| ------- | ------------------ |  
| 2.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |  
| < 2.5   | :x:                |  
  
## Security Considerations  
  
### Sensitive Data Handling  
  
SAGECONNECT processes highly sensitive financial data including:  

- SAGE 300 ERP database connections and credentials
- Multi-tenant API keys and secrets for portaldeproveedores.mx  
- CFDI (tax documents) and payment information  
- Supplier and vendor data  
  
### Environment Variable Security  
  
The system uses multiple environment files containing sensitive credentials:  
  
- `.env.credentials.database` - SQL Server authentication  
- `.env.credentials.focaltec` - Multi-tenant API credentials
- `.env.credentials.mailing` - Email service credentials  
- `.env.path` - File system paths  
  
**Critical Security Practices:**  

1. Never commit credential files to version control  
2. Use `git update-index --skip-worktree` for local credential files  
3. Restrict file system permissions on credential files (600 or 640)  
4. Regularly rotate API keys and database passwords  
  
### Database Security  
  
The system connects to multiple SQL Server databases:  

- SAGE 300 databases  
- FESA parameter database  
- Authorization databases  
  
**Security Requirements:**  

- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions  
- Enable SQL Server authentication logging  
- Implement connection encryption (TLS)  
- Regular security updates for SQL Server instances  
  
### API Security  
  
Integration with portaldeproveedores.mx API requires:  

- Secure storage of tenant-specific API keys and secrets  
- HTTPS-only communication  
- Request/response logging for audit trails  
- Rate limiting and error handling  
  
### Multi-Tenant Architecture  
  
The system supports multiple companies with indexed configuration arrays. Security considerations:  

- Tenant isolation must be maintained  
- Cross-tenant data access prevention  
- Audit logging per tenant  
- Separate credential management per tenant  
  
## Deployment Security  
  
### Production Environment  
  
When deploying with PM2:  

- Run as non-privileged user  
- Enable process monitoring and restart policies  
- Implement log rotation and secure log storage  
- Use firewall rules to restrict network access  
  
### File System Security  
  
- Restrict access to CFDI storage directories  
- Secure log file permissions  
- Regular cleanup of temporary files  
- Backup encryption for sensitive data  
  
## Logging and Monitoring  
  
The system implements comprehensive logging for security monitoring:  

- All database operations are logged
- API requests and responses are tracked  
- Error conditions trigger notifications  
- Log files are date-organized for audit trails  
  
**Security Monitoring:**  

- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Track unusual API usage patterns  
- Alert on database connection failures  
- Log file integrity monitoring  
  
## Vulnerability Reporting  
  
### Reporting Security Issues  
  
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:  
  
1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue  
2. Email security concerns to: [SECURITY_EMAIL_TO_BE_CONFIGURED]  
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability  
4. Allow reasonable time for investigation and patching  
  
### Response Timeline  
  
- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours  
- **Investigation:** Within 7 days  
- **Fix Development:** Within 30 days (depending on severity)  
- **Public Disclosure:** After fix deployment and user notification  
  
## Security Best Practices  
  
### For Developers  
  
1. **Code Review:** All changes require security review  
2. **Dependency Management:** Regular updates and vulnerability scanning  
3. **Input Validation:** Validate all external data inputs  
4. **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors  
5. **Logging:** Log security events without exposing credentials  
  
### For System Administrators  
  
1. **Access Control:** Implement principle of least privilege  
2. **Network Security:** Use VPNs and firewalls appropriately  
3. **Backup Security:** Encrypt backups and test restoration  
4. **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive security monitoring  
5. **Updates:** Keep all system components updated  
  
## Compliance Considerations  
  
Given the financial nature of the data processed:  

- Ensure compliance with local financial regulations
- Implement data retention policies  
- Consider encryption at rest for sensitive data  
- Maintain audit trails for regulatory requirements
