## Preserving Local Environment Files

This project tracks several `.env` files in the repo:

- `.env`
- `.env.credentials.database`
- `.env.credentials.focaltec`
- `.env.credentials.mailing`
- `.env.path`

To prevent your local values from being overwritten on `git pull` or `git merge`, mark them as **skip-worktree**:

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree .env
git update-index --skip-worktree .env.credentials.database
git update-index --skip-worktree .env.credentials.focaltec
git update-index --skip-worktree .env.credentials.mailing
git update-index --skip-worktree .env.path
```

## :gear: How to deploy it

After all the previous actions have been performed you will need to install some npm dependencies globally with the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
npm install pm2-windows-startup -g
npx pm2-startup install
```

Then, you must execute the following commands in order to keep the program process always running

```bash
npx pm2 start src/index.js --watch --ignore-watch="node_modules" --name sageconnect
npx pm2 save
```

If you need more information on the use of PM2 you can visit the following [PM2 Quick Start Guide](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)
